        <p>This post has to come with the disclaimer that 99.97% of ESXi deployments have
<em>NO</em> use for anything this complicated. For that 0.03% of us, ESXi can be one
heck of a deployment nightmare. It doesn't have to be, though.</p>
<div class="section" id="background-the-situation">
<h2>Background: The Situation</h2>
<p>The company I work for has hundreds of remote facilities and each of these
facilities connects back to our main office. Most of the time this is a pair of
T1 lines, but sometimes it's just a single line. Each facility needs local file
storage. They need other things locally, but the file storage is easy to put
into perspective.</p>
<p>The easy answer is to deploy a server at each facility that keeps data locally
and synchronizes with our main office.</p>
<p>Well, we will want to replace this hardware someday so obviously we'll want
virtualization. There are many options out there and we almost went with proxmox
but in the end settled on ESXi.</p>
<p>So now we will have an ESXi host at each facility and virtual machines running
on it. The ESXi install is rather light and doing that remotely is no real
headache. However, we also need to install customized servers on each one. Each
of these servers needs to pull a lot of data during installation and installing
at the facility makes no sense. Installing locally and pushing the image to the
ESXi host at the facility is equally absurd. In our case, this could be a few
weeks.</p>
<p>This is the situation we were faced with.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-solution">
<h2>The Solution</h2>
<p>The solution was to build a single thumb drive that did a complete deployment of
the ESXi host and all the virtual machines without touching the network.</p>
<p>Sounds simple or impossible depending on your understanding of ESXi. The answer
is actually somewhere in between. It's incredibly difficult to figure out
because even ESXi developers told me it wasn't possible. Once you figure it out,
it's not horrible to repeat the process.</p>
<p>Basically:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Build the Virtual Machines to be put in the install</li>
<li>Export them to an OVA file</li>
<li>Put the OVA files on a web server</li>
<li>Put the installer on the thumb drive</li>
<li>Modify the installer to include the images</li>
<li>Set up first boot stuff</li>
<li>Create an image</li>
<li>Set up a thumb drive to deploy that image</li>
</ol>
<p>Sounds easy, right? Sure...</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-the-ova">
<h2>Creating the OVA</h2>
<p>I'll breeze over this section. All you want to do is deploy a local ESXi server,
install your virtual machines, and configure them as needed. If they're Linux
boxes, then you will probably have a first boot script embedded. If it's a
Windows server, don't forget the sysprep.</p>
<p>Once the virtual servers are ready, turn them off. Export them as an OVA. The
OVF option will create a few files where the OVA will stick everything in one
file.</p>
<p>Upload those files to a web server.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="esxi-on-usb-thumb-drive">
<h2>ESXi on USB Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>Our ESXi install disk needed extra drivers and we just used <a class="reference external" href="http://esxi-customizer.v-front.de">ESXi Customizer</a>
to get them in there. That tool doesn't really need any explanation.</p>
<p>When you have the ESXi ISO that you plan to use, you'll want to stick it on a
USB stick. This is important because it lets you modify things easily. In my
case, my thumb drive was sdc.</p>
<p>Prepping the thumb drive:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
fdisk /dev/sdc
# Make sure only one partition consumes the entire drive
# Make sure to set the bootable flag
mkfs.vfat -n vmware_sm -F 32 /dev/sdc1
syslinux /dev/sdc1
cat /usr/lib/syslinux/mbr.bin &gt; /dev/sdc
</pre>
<p>Putting files on the thumb drive:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mkdir /mnt/{usb,iso}
mount -o loop esxi_supermicro.iso /mnt/iso
mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/usb
rsync -au /mnt/iso/ /mnt/usb
</pre>
<p>Then modify some files for use with syslinux:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cp /mnt/usb/isolinux.cfg /mnt/usb/syslinux.cfg
sed -i 's|menu.c32|mboot.c32|' /mnt/usb/syslinux.cfg
</pre>
<p>The ISO is no longer needed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
umount /mnt/iso
rmdir /mnt/iso
</pre>
<p>You can now unmount /mnt/usb if you want to verify that you can boot to it and
run the installer. For the remainder, I'll assume that you left it since we have
to still customize it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-our-customizations-the-boot-file">
<h2>Creating Our Customizations: The Boot File</h2>
<p>Later, we'll be creating ks.cfg and ovf-00.t00. For the moment, assume that they
exist. We need to tell ESXi about them.</p>
<p>Edit /mnt/usb/boot.cfg</p>
<p>In the modules line, we need to tell ESXi about ovf-00.t00. Add /ovf-00.t00 to
the list. It will look like the following.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
--- /xorg.v00 --- /OEM-00.t00 --- /ovf-00.t00 --- /imgdb.tgz
</pre>
<p>Make sure to keep the ' --- ' between each item.</p>
<p>Where you see:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
kernelopt=runweasel
</pre>
<p>Add ks=usb:/KS.CFG:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
kernelopt=runweasel ks=usb:/KS.CFG
</pre>
<p>Now the installer will know that it needs to load the /ovf-00.t00 file into
memory and used the ks.cfg file as the kickstart when booting. If you don't
quite see the magic yet, this already allows us to make the installation
fully hands off.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-our-customizations-the-kickstart">
<h2>Creating Our Customizations: The Kickstart</h2>
<p>Now we get to the fun part. The first step is to create a kickstart file. This
is rather easy. It will look very much like this:</p>
<p>Edit /mnt/usb/ks.cfg:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">

</pre>
<p>There is a lot more you can with the kickstart, and ours is massive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-our-customizations-the-ovf">
<h2>Creating Our Customizations: The OVF</h2>
<p>Notice in the above, I expect /ovf to exist. We're about to make it so! First
we need to aquire ovftools. The VMware website has an <a class="reference external" href="http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/ovf/">ovftool download</a>.</p>
<p>Download the 64bit version and install it.</p>
<p>Now we need to make /ovf and the directories inside of it.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mkdir /tmp/ovf
mkdir /tmp/ovf/tools
mkdir /tmp/ovf/files
</pre>
<p>Take the installed ovftools and stick them in the tools directory.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rsync -au /usr/lib/vmware-ovftool/* /tmp/ovf/tools/
sed -i 's/bash/sh/' /tmp/ovf/tools/ovftool
</pre>
<p>We leave an empty files directory. This is where the post install part of the
kickstart file will dump the OVA files.</p>
<p>Now we need to turn the ovf directory into ovf-00.t00.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
cd /tmp
tar cf ovf.tar ovf
gzip -9 ovf.tar
mv ovf.tar.gz /mnt/usb/ovf-00.t00
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="creating-our-customizations-finished">
<h2>Creating Our Customizations: Finished</h2>
<p>Now that you have everything done, run umount /mnt/usb. Put that usb key into
your server and boot to it. The installer will go through and do what we told
it to.</p>
<p>Once it powers off, you're ready to make an image from the installed ESXi.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="image-creation-usb-thumb-drive">
<h2>Image Creation: USB Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>For this part, we need yet another USB thumb drive. To keep this easy, just
follow these basic steps.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use a Windows box</li>
<li>Download <a class="reference external" href="http://www.linuxliveusb.com/en/download">LiLi USB Creator</a></li>
<li>Download <a class="reference external" href="http://clonezilla.org/downloads.php">Clonezilla</a> (I used the alternative stable)</li>
<li>Run LiLi</li>
<li>Tell it to install Clonezilla to a thumb drive</li>
</ol>
<p>You'll probably want to make two copies of this. One for grabbing the image
and one for pushing the image. For pushing the image, it needs to be at least
as large as the image you're creating. For getting the image, 2GB is plenty.</p>
<p>Our ESXi image was large enough that we had to split up the thumb drive. A 64GB
drive was given two partitions. The first was a 4GB FAT32 formatted partition
that we placed Clonezilla on to. The second partition was Ext2 formatted and
took up the remainder.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="image-creation-getting-the-image">
<h2>Image Creation: Getting the Image</h2>
<p>Boot to the plain Clonezilla USB drive on the ESXi server. You will probably
want to also hook up a larger external hard drive for this.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Boot to Clonezilla (I usually ping the &quot;Safe graphic&quot; option)</li>
<li>optional: Plug in external hard drive</li>
<li>I usually ping the &quot;Safe graphic&quot; option</li>
<li>For the keymap settings, default is usually fine</li>
<li>Start_Clonezilla</li>
<li>Choose device-image</li>
<li>Pick where you want the image to go (local_dev for external HD)</li>
<li>Run through the settings for that option</li>
<li>Choose the Expert setting</li>
<li>Choose savedisk</li>
<li>Give it a name</li>
<li>You probably only have one option (sda) for the local disk</li>
<li>-q2 is usually best (partclone can handle sparse vmfs)</li>
<li>Make sure to select the -nogui option!!! (I usually deselect -c)</li>
<li>Compression is your choice</li>
<li>Since this is going to ext, feel free to make a large partition size</li>
<li>I usually choose to skip any checks (not safe)</li>
</ol>
<p>For me, the command in the end looks something like this...</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
/usr/bin/ocs-sr -q2 -j2 -nogui -z1p -i 2000000 -sc -p true savedisk BArK-Image sda
</pre>
<p>Now you get to wait for the image to get created. Once it's done, power off the
box and we can start working on the deployment thumb drive.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="image-creation-clonezilla-modifications">
<h2>Image Creation: Clonezilla Modifications</h2>
<p>We're going back to that extra flash drive you made. In our case, it was 64GB.
The first 4GB partition (FAT32) has the standard Clonezilla image, for now.
The remainder of the flash drive should be a single ext2 partition. You'll want
yours to basically be the same, but maybe only a 16GB flash drive will be
needed. This second partition will hold only one thing (your image).</p>
<p>We'll want to make some changes to the stuff LiLi put on the flash drive. For
now, we'll assume the flash drive is sdb.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mkdir /mnt/sdb1
mkdir /mnt/sdb2
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/sdb1
mount /dev/sdb2 /mnt/sdb2
</pre>
<p>Now copy the image you created with Clonezilla into /mnt/sdb2 and unmount it.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rsync -au /dir/to/BArK-Image /mnt/sdb2/
umount /mnt/sdb2
</pre>
<p>That's all there is to getting our image on to the flash drive. That's not
enough, though. Sure, we could launch the vanilla clonezill on here and
tell it to use the image from the larger partition. However, we're trying to
make this fully automatic. We came this far and we're finishing the task!</p>
<p>It's worth noting that live Linux distros use squashfs. This is an amazing tool
because it lets you make a large file system into something very tiny, but this
comes with the side effect that you're not able to actually modify the files.
Instead, we have to take that file system, unpack it, repack it, and replace it.</p>
<p>To do this...</p>
<p>Edit /mnt/sdb1/syslinux/syslinux.cfg:</p>

</pre>
<p>Feel free to copy/paste that exactly as is. This basically is what makes the
interactive boot stuff in Clonezilla go away. It doesn't really do much more.</p>
<p>Moving on, we need to modify what happens after booting. You might remember
this as a sleek set of options for what we want to do. We know what we want to
do, so we're going to embed it.</p>
<p>First up is grabbing the existing squashfs image.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
mkdir /tmp/squash
mv /mnt/sdb1/live/filesystem.squashfs /tmp/squash/
cd /tmp/squash
unsquashfs filesystem.squashfs
cd squashfs-root
</pre>
<p>Now you have Clonezilla at your mercy. The first thing we want to do is burn the
menu that launches when you start.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rm etc/rc2.d/S99start-ocs-live
</pre>
<p>It's that simple. We delete that file. If you were to start up with only that
change, you'd just end up at a shell. Now we need to tell it what to do when it
boots up.</p>
<p>Edit etc/rc.local:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
#!/bin/bash
mkdir /home/partimag
mount /dev/sdb2 /home/partimag
yes y | /usr/sbin/ocs-sr -e2 -nogui -c -r -j2 -p /usr/sbin/ocs-finished restoredisk BArK-Image sda

<p>Edit usr/sbin/ocs-finished:</p>

sudo poweroff
</pre>
<p>Make sure it's executable:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
chmod +x usr/sbin/ocs-finished
</pre>
<p>This assumes that you named your image BArK-Image, as I did. Case matters!</p>
<p>Now we need to create the new squashfs and put it on the flash drive.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
rm ../filesystem.squashfs
mksquashfs * ../filesystem.squashfs

cp ../filesystem.squashfs /mnt/sdb1/live/filesystem.squashfs
</pre>
<p>That's all there is to it! Simple!</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="using-it">
<h2>Using It</h2>
<p>Simply boot to it. Done. It'll deploy that image to the first disk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-thoughts">
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>This is a very complicated process. As I stated before, it's for edge cases
ONLY. If you're dealing with normal business needs, there are far superior
options out there. For the other 0.03% out there, I really hope this can take
you easily from the start to the end of this insane task.</p>
